Ciphers

This Java assignment was to implement a classical cipher system that performs encryption and decryption using techniques like Caesar Shift, Substitution Cipher, and multi-layer encryption via chaining.

Objectives:
- Practice writing clean and modular Java code with inheritance and polymorphism

- Implement and extend abstract classes to define reusable cipher structures

- Develop encryption and decryption logic using classical algorithms

- Write and run unit tests using JUnit to verify cipher correctness

Breakdown:
- Implement abstract Cipher class to define the structure for all cipher types

- Build specific ciphers like CaesarShift and Substitution with custom logic

- Chain multiple ciphers using MultiCipher to apply layered encryption

- Provide a Client class for interactive testing and demonstration

- Test each cipher implementation with Testing.java

- Use example files (hamlet.txt, simple.txt, etc.) for encryption trials
